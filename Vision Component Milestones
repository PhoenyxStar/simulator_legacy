ROBOSUB Rough outline
Goals and timelines for Vision requirements

Fall Semester, 2015.
---------------------------------------

* at any given time *
- Collaberate with other group members and determine where work is needed most.
* at any given time *

Friday, Oct 2nd: 
- Understand how the Camera speaks to the Broker. 
- Understand how the Image needs to be processed (*plan a design* for a class to handle the data).
- Research TCP/IP, get a rough feel for how the data is going to be relayed through the system.

Friday, Oct 16th:
- Plan to have starter code that can store the image data, and is not overly complicated. Simplicity 
is the main goal for this milestone.
- Continue researching TCP/IP if there are any uncertainties with how Vision communicates with system.
- Make as many simple abstractions as possible. The simpler the implementation, the easier it is for 
the rest of the group to utilize.

Friday, Oct 30th - Friday, Nov 13th:
- A working abstraction of the Vision class should be in place. The next step is to implement Unit tests.
- Ensure that the Images can be communicated to parts of the sub that need them as inputs. It is very 
important that the images are handled efficiently eventually, but at first; just passing images to other 
components should be possible.
- Many forms of testing should be in place to ensure Vision protocol is working as expected, Or determine
where bugs arise and how to eliminate as many unexpected bugs as possible. DEBUG, TEST, DEBUG! repeat.
- Any further neccessary research for uncertain topics should be weighed and considered at this time.

Friday, Nov 27th:
- Success in many tests should be accomplished by this point. Work on revisions, run more unit tests, and 
stress the components. Refine the Vision abstractions and strive for efficiency without breaking the working
model.

December:
- Testing should be the top priority in December. All programming *SHOULD* be in place at this point.
